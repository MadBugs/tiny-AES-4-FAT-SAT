This is code in the process in creation . . .

It has been done quickly and there is lots of space for clean up.

The code has been done with endiness-independence in mind but it is still not endiness-independent. 

It only works in Little-Endian 64 bit machines, like latest Intel PC

It has been tested in a few versions of Linux and in cygwin.

Have fun.

JL.

PS. You are on your own to debug this. Maybe not.
